# 🎵 Limited Edition NFT Collectibles Platform

Welcome to the ultimate Web3 solution for artists and musicians to create, mint, and distribute authentic limited-edition digital collectibles! This project addresses real-world problems in the creative industry, such as counterfeiting, unfair royalty distribution, lack of provenance, and limited access to global markets for independent creators. Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, creators can mint NFTs for art or music with built-in royalties, verifiable scarcity, and community-driven features, ensuring fair compensation and ownership transparency.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Mint limited-edition NFTs with enforced scarcity (e.g., editions capped at 1-1000)  
💰 Automatic royalty splits for creators and collaborators on every resale  
📜 Immutable provenance tracking for each collectible's history  
🛒 Marketplace for direct sales, auctions, and fractional ownership  
🤝 Community governance for platform decisions and creator grants  
✅ Authenticity verification through on-chain metadata and hashes  
🎁 Staking rewards for holders to earn exclusive perks or tokens  
🚫 Anti-fraud measures to prevent unauthorized minting or duplicates  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Creators (Artists/Musicians)**  
- Upload your digital art or music file and generate a unique content hash (e.g., IPFS CID or SHA-256).  
- Use the minting contract to create a limited-edition NFT collection, specifying edition limits, royalty percentages, and metadata (title, description, previews).  
- List your NFTs on the marketplace for fixed-price sales or auctions.  
- Earn royalties automatically on secondary sales, with splits for collaborators if defined.  

**For Collectors/Buyers**  
- Browse collections via the marketplace contract and purchase NFTs using STX or custom tokens.  
- Verify authenticity and ownership history using the provenance and verification contracts.  
- Stake your NFTs to earn rewards, such as exclusive access to new drops or artist events.  
- Participate in governance votes to influence platform features or fund new creators.  

**For Verifiers/Community**  
- Query the verification contract with an NFT ID to confirm scarcity, ownership, and hash integrity.  
- Use governance tools to propose and vote on changes, ensuring the platform evolves fairly.  

This setup solves key issues: Creators get perpetual royalties (unlike traditional platforms that take high cuts), collectors have provable ownership (reducing fakes), and the community drives sustainability through decentralized decision-making.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

The platform is built with 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability on Stacks. Each handles a specific aspect to keep the system efficient and auditable:

1. **NFT-Minter.clar**: Handles minting of limited-edition NFTs, enforcing edition caps, storing metadata, and linking content hashes.  
2. **Royalty-Distributor.clar**: Manages royalty calculations and automatic payouts on resales, supporting multi-party splits (e.g., artist + producer).  
3. **Provenance-Tracker.clar**: Records and queries the full ownership history and transfer logs for each NFT.  
4. **Marketplace-Listing.clar**: Allows listing NFTs for fixed-price sales, with escrow for secure transactions.  
5. **Auction-Engine.clar**: Runs timed auctions with bidding logic, reserve prices, and winner determination.  
6. **Governance-DAO.clar**: Enables token-based voting for proposals, such as fee changes or grant allocations.  
7. **Verification-Oracle.clar**: Provides read-only functions to verify NFT authenticity, scarcity, and metadata integrity.  
8. **Staking-Rewards.clar**: Manages NFT staking pools, reward distributions, and unstaking with lock-up periods for holder incentives.

These contracts interact seamlessly (e.g., Marketplace calls Royalty-Distributor on sales), ensuring a robust ecosystem. Start by deploying the NFT-Minter and build from there—full deployment scripts coming soon!
